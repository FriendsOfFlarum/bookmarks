/**
 * Keeps bookmarked blog articles in the bookmarks list.
 *
 * fof/blog's `HideBlogPostsFromAllDiscussionsPage` mutator excludes blog-tagged
 * discussions from every `DiscussionSearcher` query, standing down only when a blog or
 * fulltext filter is active. A bookmarks listing is neither, so without this the article
 * is saved as a bookmark but never shown.
 *
 * Blog hides articles with `whereNotIn('discussions.id', <blog-tagged>)`. Unpicking that
 * constraint is not possible from here, so instead the whole accumulated set of
 * constraints is wrapped and OR'd with "is one of the actor's bookmarks":
 *
 *     (<everything applied so far>) or discussions.id in (<actor's bookmarks>)
 *
 * `Builder::orWhere()` with a closure produces exactly that nesting. It is safe against
 * the visibility scope the searcher starts from, because the right-hand side of the OR is
 * itself constrained to `whereVisibleTo($actor)` — so a discussion the actor may not see
 * cannot be re-admitted even if they somehow hold a bookmark row for it.
