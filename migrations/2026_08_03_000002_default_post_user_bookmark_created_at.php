/*
 * Brings a pre-existing `post_user_bookmark` table in line with the one this extension
 * creates.
 *
 * clarkwinkelmann/flarum-ext-post-bookmarks created the table with Laravel's
 * `timestamps()` helper, giving two `NOT NULL` columns with no default. This extension
 * inserts through a relationship that writes neither, relying on
 * `DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` instead, so `created_at` needs a default and the unused
 * `updated_at` has to become nullable.
 *
 * Raw statements are used because changing a column with Laravel's schema builder needs
 * doctrine/dbal to reflect the whole table, which fails on the enum columns elsewhere in
 * a typical Flarum database.
 *
 * Flarum 2 supports MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite, and the DDL to change a column differs
 * on each, so each driver is handled separately:
 *
 *  - MySQL uses `MODIFY`.
 *  - PostgreSQL uses `ALTER COLUMN`, one clause per change.
 *  - SQLite cannot alter a column at all. Nothing needs to be done there: the legacy
 *    extensions that created this table without the right defaults were MySQL-only, so a
 *    SQLite database only ever has the table created by this extension, which is already
 *    correct.
